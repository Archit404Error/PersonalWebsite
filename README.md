# Archit's Personal Website

This repository contains the code for my personal website, live at [architmehta.me](https://architmehta.me)

The website contains an overview of my projects, work experience, education, and interests.

I built this website from scratch in TypeScript using Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

To download and customize this project, first make sure you've set up yarn. Then, run:
```
git clone https://github.com/Archit404Error/PersonalWebsite
yarn install
```

To run the development server, run `yarn dev`. You can generate a build via `yarn build` and can run the production server via `yarn start`.
